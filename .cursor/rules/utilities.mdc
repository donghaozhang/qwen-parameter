# Utility Functions Guide

## Core Utilities
[utils.py](mdc:utils.py) contains shared utility functions used throughout the codebase.

## Common Patterns
When working with the codebase, import utility functions from [utils.py](mdc:utils.py) rather than reimplementing common functionality.

## Archive
The [archive/](mdc:archive) directory contains older versions of code that are kept for reference but are no longer actively used in the main workflow.
